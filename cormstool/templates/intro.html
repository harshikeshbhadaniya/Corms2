<h1 class="display-6">CORMS: A GitHub and Gerrit based Hybrid Code Reviewer
    Recommendation Approach for Modern Code Review</h1>
<p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">Our proposed
hybrid approach, CORMS, works on similarity analysis to compute
similarities among file-paths, projects/sub-projects, author information, and prediction models to recommend reviewers based on
the subject of the change. We conducted a detailed analysis on the
widely used 20 projects of both Gerrit and GitHub to compare our
results with RevFinder. Our results reveal that on average, CORMS,
can achieve top-1, top-3, top-5, and top-10 accuracies, and Mean
Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 45.1%, 67.5%, 74.6%, 79.9% and 0.58 for
the 20 projects, consequently improves the RevFinder approach by
44.9%, 34.4%, 20.8%, 12.3% and 18.4%, respectively.</p>
